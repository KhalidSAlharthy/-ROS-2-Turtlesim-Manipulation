# ROS-2-Turtlesim-Manipulation
basic manipulation and control of the turtlesim package in ROS 2. It includes launching the simulation, moving the turtle using commands, publishing to topics, and calling services.

# Requirements
ROS 2 (e.g., Foxy, Galactic, Humble, etc.)

turtlesim package (usually included by default)

# Documentation File
I created a PDF file "AItask" that includes various turtlesim manipulations in ROS 2.
The file contains:

The commands I used (topics, services, parameters)

The outputs and results (terminal output, turtle behavior, etc.)

It serves as a step-by-step documentation or reference guide for working with turtlesim.
